A school project :
creat a little AI (artificial intelligent) to explain the basics of AI

I program a little AI, who plays the game HEXAPAWN and learn every time he lose

the left-placed-player always begin and the AI is on the right

The game is like chess but just the pawn like this :

X_________X

X_________X

X_________X
